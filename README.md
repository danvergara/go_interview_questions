go interview questions
==============

A set of solved interview questions written in Go.

This started as a simple series of programming exercises to perform well in incoming interviews.

Initially based off this [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/clcoding/status/1562264399515090945) on Python Interview Questions.
I took the challenge to translate those examples into Go code.
