go interview questions
==============

A set of interview questions, written in Go.

This started as a simple series of programming exercises to perform well in upcoming interviews.

Initially, I based this project off of [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/clcoding/status/1562264399515090945) on Python Interview Questions. I took the challenge of translating those examples into Go code.
